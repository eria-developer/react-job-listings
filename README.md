# Simple application to list jobs

I have built a simple react application that displays jobs.
I have a file named jobs.json where i hard coded the json format jobs. however whne developing i used a package named json server which chnaged that file to an api.
I implemented the CRUD functions and some core functionalities like usestate, useeffect, react router etc.
